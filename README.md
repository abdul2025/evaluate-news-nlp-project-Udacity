### What is NLP ?

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
> concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
> process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

### Using the API endpoints

take a look at [here](https://docs.aylien.com/textapi/endpoints/#api-endpoints). And you can see how using the SDK simplifies the requests we need to make.

## Deploying

A great step to take with your finished project would be to deploy it! Unfortunately its a bit out of scope for me to explain too much about how to do that here, but checkout [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for some really intuitive free hosting options.
